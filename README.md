## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts (MathQuill)

| Shortcut | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `/` | Create a fraction (a/b → 𝑎⁄𝑏) |
| `^` | Superscript (x^2 → 𝑥²) |
| `_` | Subscript (x_1 → 𝑥₁) |
| `\sqrt` | Square root |
| `\frac` | Fraction |
| `\sum` | Summation |
| `\int` | Integral |
| `\alpha` etc. | Greek letters |
| `→`, `≤`, `≥`, `≠` | Common operators |

## ⚠️ Limitations

While **MathQuill** is an excellent open-source math editor, it has certain limitations compared to full LaTeX environments. Some symbols and expressions are **not natively supported** or may render incorrectly.  

### ❌ Not Fully Supported Symbols

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Chemical / Reaction Symbols** | `⇌`, `⟷`, `⇄` | Reversible reaction arrows are not available by default. |
| **Advanced Calculus** | `∮`, indefinite integration signs | Only definite integrals are supported. |
| **Accents and Decorations** | `\hat{}`, `\tilde{}`, `\check{}` | Limited or inconsistent behavior in MathQuill. |
| **Matrix / Array Environments** | `\begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}` | Multi-line environments not supported. |
| **Text Formatting** | `\text{}`, `\mathrm{}`, `\mathcal{}` | Some styles may not display as expected. |

---

### 💡 Workarounds

- Use **plain LaTeX** directly in the output area for unsupported symbols.  
- Copy the generated LaTeX and manually adjust it in your LaTeX editor or Overleaf.  
- For advanced rendering needs (e.g., reaction arrows or tensors), consider combining **MathJax-only editing**, you can do it from here [LaTex Equation Editor](https://tanvir6307.github.io/latex-equation-editor/)
